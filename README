Doosan2.py is the main movement code for the robot.
you have to have all these file for robot to run:
server.py, depth_how.py, stacking algorithm.py, storage.py, randomsize.py, login.py, HUI.py, barcode.py, and finally doosan2.py
you also need DRL studio in order to run the robot.
if all requirement is met, start the server first by clicking the "run" button in drl studio, then go to HUI files, right click and run.
if there are any question, ask us on robot exchange.
